## Introduction

In preparation of entering the movie production business, Microsoft has asked me to prepare an analysis of current movie trends and to generate suggestions as to where to invest capital and how they can be sussesful in producing profitable movies. I will be analysing several datasets and making inferences off of financial information, ratings and popularity scores, as well as looking at established industry professionals to make suggestions on what genres and types of films to invest in and who to attach to projects to create buzz and generate an audience.

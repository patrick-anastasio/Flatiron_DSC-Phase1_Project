They lack the experience and industry knowledge that many of the top studios possess. Several factors go into producing a succesful movie. There are a few over-arching features that we will focus on: (1) gross revenue of the top rated and top grossing movies of the modern film era, (2) popular and highly rated genres, and (3) industry professionals who were instrumental in creating these movies."
